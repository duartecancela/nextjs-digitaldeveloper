To create a Symfony project with a CRUD associated with a Product entity using the command line, along with installing **MakerBundle** and **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**, you can follow these steps:

## 1. Install Symfony CLI

If you haven't already, you need to install Symfony CLI. You can find installation instructions here: https://symfony.com/download

## 2. Create Symfony Project

Run the following command to create a new Symfony project:

```bash
symfony new my_project_name --version="7.1.*" --webapp
```

> Replace `my_project_name` with the name of your project.

## 3. Navigate to Project Directory

```bash
cd my_project_name
```

## 4. Create Product Entity

To create a Product entity, run the following command:

```bash
php bin/console make:entity Product
```

Follow the prompts to define the fields for your `Product` entity.

## 5. Create CRUD Operations

Use Symfony's MakerBundle to create CRUD operations:

```bash
php bin/console make:crud Product
```

This command will generate controllers, forms, templates, and routing for CRUD operations related to the `Product` entity.

## 6. Database Setup

If you haven't already, configure your database settings in the `.env` file. Then run:

```bash
php bin/console doctrine:database:create
php bin/console make:migration
php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```

This will create the tables needed for your `Product` entity.

## 7. Run the Symfony Server

```bash
symfony server:start
```

## 8. Access CRUD Interface

Once the server is running, you can access the CRUD interface by visiting:

```
http://localhost:8000/product
```

That's it! You've created a Symfony project with CRUD operations for a Product entity using the command line.
