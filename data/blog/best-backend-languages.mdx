- [**Python**](https://www.python.org/): Python is a versatile and powerful programming language that is widely used in web development. Its simplicity, readability, and extensive community make it an excellent choice for building web applications.

- [**Ruby**](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/): Ruby is another popular programming language for web development. Its focus on readability and ease of use, as well as its strong community support, make it a great choice for building web applications.

- [**Java**](https://www.java.com/en/): Java is a robust and scalable programming language that is widely used in enterprise-level web application development. It is well-suited for building large-scale, complex applications.

- [**JavaScript**](https://www.javascript.com/): JavaScript is a programming language that is widely used for front-end web development, but it can also be used for back-end development. Its versatility and ability to work with other technologies make it a great choice for building web applications.
